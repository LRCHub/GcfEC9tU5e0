Walking with the humans
But I don't think I'm like them at all
We're all wearing the same suits
But it doesn't seem right anymore
Dreaming in the daylight
And they say that we're going nowhere
Looking for the unsung if I listen
I know I can hear
And I can't see a reason for this Mr
Not without madness going on
Living for the young ones
can't ignore the feeling
But I like it like that in the unknown
Living under one roof I don't even know you
But I like it like that in the unknown
Living for the young ones
when they gonna listen
I just need a reason
living in a world without one
Is it magic that makes us
Or is it something in the blue sky
We're all speaking with the same tongue
but I know that we don't think alike
Walking through the unknown lets make sure
we don't do it alone
I just need a reason just to know
that I'm doing it right
And I can't see a reason for this Mr
Not without madness going on
Living for the young ones
can't ignore the feeling
But I like it like that in the unknown
Living under one roof I don't even know you
But I like it like that in the unknown
Living for the young ones
when they gonna listen
I just need a reason living
in a world without one
